# **The Prince and the Picked Flower**

The days that followed the prince’s arrival were not days, but a held breath. Oakhaven became a place of whispers and shadows. Villagers slunk from door to door, eyes darting toward the occupied miller’s house as if it were a tomb that had sprouted a garrison. The body of Old Manus had been removed, but a dark, indelible stain remained in the square, a silent sermon on the new order.

Inside his commandeered quarters, Prince Kaelros was succumbing to a familiar, gnawing emptiness. The novelty of terrorizing the peasantry had worn thin in under a week. Their fear was too easy, too abject. It lacked artistry. Killing them was like snuffing out tallow candles—a brief, smoky end, leaving only a foul smell. Boredom, his oldest and most vicious companion, coiled around him once more.

On the sixth morning, an idea, perverse in its simplicity, occurred to him. He would walk among them unseen. Not as their prince, but as a ghost. To observe the mice when they believed the cat was away. Perhaps, in their unguarded moments, he would find a spark worth extinguishing in a more creative way.

He exchanged his black silks for the rough-spun tunic and trousers of a woodsman, dirtied his hands, and pulled a wide-brimmed hat low over his distinctive pale hair. He left by the back, a specter slipping into his own nightmare. The effect was immediate and satisfying. The village, while still tense, was alive. A woman beat a rug, her face pinched with worry, not paralyzing fear. Two old men muttered over a game of stones. A child darted across the lane, chasing a chicken. They saw a stranger, but not the Stranger. It was a play performed just for him.

He walked with a hunter’s silence, his pale eyes missing nothing, finding all of it dull. The petty concerns, the simple joys—it was all a pathetic pantomime. His contempt was a cold stone in his gut. He found himself on the old stone bridge that arched over the mill creek, leaning on the parapet, watching the water carry away fallen leaves. This, he thought, is the sum of a world. Drift and decay. I should burn it all and be done with it.

Then, he saw her.

Down by the water’s edge, where the wild lavender grew in thick, fragrant clouds, a girl was picking flowers. She moved with a gentle, absorbed grace, her fingers careful as she selected the finest stems and laid them in a small wicker basket. The morning sun, filtering through the willow leaves, caught in her chestnut hair, weaving it with threads of gold. She hummed a tuneless, peaceful little melody, the sound carried softly to him on the breeze.

Prince Kaelros went very still.

The cold stone of his contempt did not warm; it shattered. A feeling, sharp and utterly alien, lanced through the void inside him. It wasn't desire, not as he understood it—a thing to be taken and discarded. It was a terrible, captivating recognition. Here, in this mire of dullness, was something… unbroken. Something that still hummed. Her innocence was not a weakness; it was a radiance, and it burned against the barren darkness of his soul.

He watched, transfixed, as she straightened, brushed a stray lock from her cheek with the back of her wrist, and turned to leave. The spell was almost broken. A frown touched his brow. What is this? he thought, the words a silent snarl in his own mind. This… ache. This need to see.

It was not love. Love is a thing that grows in fertile soil. This was the obsession of a creature who sees, for the first time, a single, perfect flame in an eternal night, and must possess it, not to cherish it, but to see if its light can fill his own hollow core—or if it will be more beautiful to smother it.

“How… curious,” he murmured aloud, the words tasting strange.

Forgetting his purpose, forgetting his boredom, he moved. The predator became a shadow. He followed her at a distance, his trained footsteps making no sound on the packed earth. He watched the way her skirt swayed, the careful way she held her basket of lavender, as if it held the world’s treasures. He saw her stop to greet a hidden cat, her smile quick and bright. Each simple action was a drop of acid on his soul, etching her deeper into his awareness.

He followed her past the square, down the winding lane, to a modest cottage with a herb garden by the door. He watched her push it open and disappear inside, the sound of her voice calling, “Mother, I’m back!” floating out into the still air.

Prince Kaelros stood in the dappled shadows of a tall oak across the way. He noted the house. He noted the blue door. He noted the lavender now likely sitting in a jar on a windowsill inside.

A slow, thin smile spread across his lips. It held no warmth. It was the smile of a man who has just found a new, exquisitely complex game.

The hunt was over. The trap was now being built.

Lyra Hale was in mortal danger, and she did not even know she had been seen.
