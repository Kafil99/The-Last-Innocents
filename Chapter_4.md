# **The Happiest Days**

What followed were the golden hours of their young lives—a season where time seemed to stretch, sweet and slow, like honey in the sun.

Now hand-in-hand, their world took on a gentle, gilded glow. They still had their picnics in the sun-dappled clearing, but Aren would arrive early to lay out the blanket just so, and Lyra would come with a small basket, always including his favorite oat cakes. As she wove crowns from clover and cornflowers, he’d watch her fingers work, mesmerized by their careful grace.

Their study sessions in Lyra’s kitchen grew quieter, more intimate. Heads bent close over the same book, they would whisper explanations to one another, their breaths mingling in the shared space between them. A touch on the wrist, a brush of a shoulder—each small contact now carried the weight of a confession.

Village gatherings transformed. Where they once lingered at the edges, they now stood together at the center. During harvest dances, Aren’s hands would find Lyra’s waist, and though his steps were sometimes awkward, her guiding touch and bright laughter made him feel steady. Under the warm glow of lantern light, they moved as if in their own private world.

They began to chase horizons. One misty morning, they climbed the highest hill east of Oakhaven to watch the sunrise. Wrapped in a shared woolen shawl, their fingers tightly laced, they watched in silent awe as the sky blushed rose-gold. Aren showed Lyra his secret trails—paths to hidden glades and silent ponds where dragonflies skimmed the water. In return, Lyra would bring her leather-bound book of tales to the old oak tree, reading aloud stories of brave knights and lost kingdoms, her voice a soft melody against the rustling leaves.

They spoke of the future openly, their dreams now braided together. Aren, looking out over the thatched roofs of the village, mused about building a small cottage one day—with a wide window to catch the morning light. Lyra’s eyes would sparkle as she described the garden she’d plant: rows of sage and lavender, a climbing rose by the door, and a little bench under the eaves for rainy days.

Their families observed this new chapter with affectionate warmth. Mira would catch Aren’s dreamy expression and tease, “Off to see your north star again?” but her smile was genuine, glad to see her brother so content. Yuta, now eleven, would roll his eyes dramatically when he saw them holding hands, shouting, “Ugh, not again!”—but he’d also trail after Aren, asking him how to whittle a proper whistle. Their parents exchanged knowing, peaceful glances over shared dinners, seeing the honest, good love between their children as the purest kind of blessing.

For a beautiful, fleeting season, Aren Vale and Lyra Hale were not just childhood friends. They were two halves of a whole, living in a perfect, sunlit chapter written just for them. Their love was a quiet, sturdy, and joyful thing—a shelter they built together, stone by tender stone, certain it would last forever.

They were, in every sense, innocents. And in their innocence, they never heard the first, distant notes of the dirge that was already winding its way toward their peaceful village, from the dark forests where light does not reach, and happy endings are just another kind of lie waiting to be shattered.
