# **The Happiest Days**

What followed were the golden hours of their young lives. Now hand-in-hand, their world seemed to glow brighter.

They still had picnics, but now Aren would bring a blanket to spread out, and Lyra would weave flower crowns for them both. They still studied, but now their heads were bent so close together they touched. They still attended village gatherings, but now they danced together, clumsy and laughing, under the lantern light.

They explored further, climbing the highest hill to watch the sunrise, their fingers laced tightly. Aren showed Lyra his favorite hidden trails, and Lyra read him stories under the old oak tree. They shared dreams openly now—dreams that had begun to include each other. Aren talked of building a cottage one day, and Lyra’s eyes would sparkle as she described the garden she’d plant beside it.

Their families watched this new chapter with warm, knowing eyes. Mira would tease Aren gently, but her smile was genuine. Yuta, now a little older, would pretend to gag at their affection, but he’d also look up to Aren with budding hero-worship. Their parents were content, seeing the simple, honest love between their children as a blessing in their quiet world.

For a beautiful, fleeting season, Aren Vale and Lyra Hale were not just childhood friends. They were two halves of a whole, living in a perfect, sunlit chapter of their story. Their love was a quiet, sturdy, and joyful thing—a shelter they built together, certain it would last forever.

They were, in every sense, innocents. And in their innocence, they never heard the first, distant notes of the dirge that was already winding its way toward their peaceful village, from the dark forests where light does not reach, and happy endings are just another kind of lie waiting to be shattered.
