# **The Confession at the Mill**

The unspoken truth became the quiet third companion on all their outings. It was in the way Aren’s hand would hover near the small of her back as they crossed a stream. It was in the way Lyra began to braid tiny lavender sprigs into her hair on days she knew she’d see him.

The confession came not in their sunlit clearing, but by the old, crumbling mill on an evening painted in shades of violet and gold. They had gone to watch the fireflies awaken. The air was cool, and Lyra shivered slightly.

“Here,” Aren said softly, draping his worn jacket over her shoulders. His hands lingered for a second.

Lyra pulled the jacket close, smelling the familiar scents of woodsmoke and warm boy. She took a deep, steadying breath. The courage that made her defend younger children and speak her mind in class now gathered in her heart.

“Aren,” she said, her voice barely above the murmur of the waterwheel.

“Hmm?”

She turned to face him, her expression serious yet soft. “I need to tell you something, and I’m afraid it will change everything.”

Aren’s heart hammered against his ribs. “Tell me.”

“I… I don’t think I can just be your friend anymore.” The words tumbled out in a rush before she lost her nerve. “When you’re not there, the day feels like it’s missing its color. When I see something beautiful, my first thought is to show it to you. I don’t just care for you, Aren. I’m in love with you. I have been for a long time.”

Silence hung between them, filled only by the chirping of crickets. Aren saw the vulnerability in her eyes, the brave fear of someone who had just offered their heart with no guarantee it would be caught.

He didn’t smile. He didn’t laugh. His expression was one of pure, awestruck relief. He reached out, his calloused fingers gently brushing a strand of hair from her cheek.

“Lyra Hale,” he whispered, his voice thick with emotion. “You have been the best part of every one of my days since I can remember. Loving you isn’t something that happened. It’s something I’ve always been doing, I just didn’t have the word for it.”

A tear escaped Lyra’s eye, but it was chased away by a radiant smile. Aren leaned forward, closing the small distance between them, and pressed his lips to hers. It was not a dramatic, world-spinning kiss, but a gentle, tender seal on a promise they had been making to each other for years. It was a beginning, and it felt like coming home.
