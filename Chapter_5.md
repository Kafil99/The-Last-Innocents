# **The Arrival**

The peace that had settled over Aren and Lyra’s world was the fragile kind—the kind that feels so deep, so endless, you forget it can be torn.

It ended with dust.

A plume of it, rising from the eastern road one windless afternoon, dark against the clear summer sky. Aren saw it first from the hilltop where he and Lyra were sketching clouds. A cold, formless dread coiled in his stomach long before the banners became visible. These were not the bright colors of a merchant caravan.

“Soldiers,” Lyra whispered, her hand tightening around his. The warmth of their touch now felt like a tiny, desperate shield.

The village bell began to toll—not the steady call to supper, but a frantic, uneven clang that hurled Oakhaven into silent, fearful motion. Doors slammed. Shutters rattled closed. In the square, old Manus dropped the bucket he was hauling from the well, the water spreading in the dust like a dark omen.

They came not as visitors, but as a possession.

A column of men in black-lacquered armor, their faces hidden behind helmets fashioned into snarling beasts, marched with a discipline that was violent in its silence. At their heart rode Prince Kaelros.

At nineteen, he was a portrait of ruinous beauty. Hair the color of cold moonlight fell around sharp, elegant features. His eyes, a pale, unsettling grey, scanned the cowering village with the detached interest of a collector inspecting insects. He wore no crown, needing none—his authority was a living chill that rolled ahead of him, withering the very air.

He stopped his black destrier in the center of the village square. The only sounds were the creak of leather, the champ of the bit, and the terrified breathing of a hundred hidden souls.

“This will do,” he said. His voice was soft, melodious, and carried the resonance of a grave being dug. “A quiet little nest. We stay until I am bored.”

His gaze swept over the empty windows, the still lanes. A faint, cruel smile touched his lips. He had not earned his throne through diplomacy or love. He had taken it three months prior in a single, blood-drenched night, silencing the king and queen—his own parents—with a poison as silent as it was agonizing. Mercy was a currency he did not recognize. Life was a temporary, disposable condition.

To prove the point, his eyes landed on Old Manus, still frozen by the well, a tremor running through his aged frame.

“You,” Kaelros said, the word a whip-crack in the silence.

Manus did not—could not—move.

The Prince sighed, a sound of profound boredom. He made a minute gesture with a gloved hand.

One of the beast-helmed guards dismounted. There was no command, no accusation. The guard’s sword flashed, a single, efficient arc. A wet thud. A gasp that was not Manus’s, but that of the entire village witnessing from the cracks in their doors.

The old man’s body slumped to the ground. The head rolled a few feet, coming to rest facing the Prince, eyes wide with a surprise that had no time to become fear.

Kaelros did not look at the corpse. He looked at the dark, spreading stain in the dust.

“Let that,” he said, his voice still that same, gentle murmur, “be the only lesson required. This village is mine. Your lives are mine. You breathe because I do not yet find the sound irritating.”

He nudged his horse forward, the guards falling into step. They commandeered the largest house at the north end—the old miller’s home—without a word to its fleeing inhabitants. The prince disappeared inside, and the village of Oakhaven ceased to breathe.

From their hiding place behind the smithy’s woodpile, Aren held Lyra so tightly he feared he might break her. He could feel the violent hammering of her heart against his chest, or perhaps it was his own. Her face was buried in his shoulder, muffling her sobs.

“Don’t look,” he breathed into her hair, his own voice trembling. “Lyra, don’t look.”

But he had looked. He had seen the prince’s face. He had seen not rage, not hatred, but a chilling, empty apathy. The killing had been as thoughtless as swatting a fly. It was not an act of evil born from passion, but from a profound, absolute nothingness where a soul should have been.

The sun still shone. The lavender still scented the air. But the golden season was over. A new, dark chapter had arrived on horseback, dressed in black, and baptized the stones of Oakhaven in innocent blood.

The dirge was no longer distant. It was here, and it had begun with a single, silent stroke.
