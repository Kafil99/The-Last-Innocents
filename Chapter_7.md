# **The Day I Cried The Most**

Prince Kaelros did not request. He did not negotiate. To him, the world was a menu, and he took what he wanted. The throne had taught him that. All it had cost was the lives of the two people who gave him life. The word “no” was not a refusal to him; it was a temporary obstacle, and obstacles were removed.

The morning after he saw her, the village of Oakhaven woke to a false peace. The sun was bright. The soldiers were quiet in their stolen quarters. It was a trap laid by calm.

Inside the Hale cottage, Lyra pushed eggs around her plate. Her parents ate in worried silence. Her little brother Yuta kicked the table leg, bored.

“He’ll be back tomorrow,” her mother said softly, reading Lyra’s face. Aren had left with his father two days prior for work in the next valley. Three days, he’d promised. For Lyra, each hour had been a year carved from stone. *When are you going to come back… Aren*, her heart whispered, a constant, aching prayer.

She clung to that promise. Tomorrow.

The day passed, slow and thick as honey. Dusk came. They gathered for a simple dinner—potato soup and bread. Yuta, restless, poked Lyra’s arm, trying to make her laugh. She offered a weak smile, her ears straining for a sound that wasn’t there—Aren’s familiar knock at the blue door.

The sound that came instead was not a knock.

It was a SPLINTERING CRACK that shook the walls.

The heavy oak door exploded inward, shattering into spear-like shards. Four guards in black beast-helmets filled the doorway, silhouetted against the dying twilight.

Chaos.

Lyra’s mother screamed. Yuta froze, his eyes wide. Lyra’s father was on his feet in an instant, his chair clattering to the floor. He stepped in front of his family, his big, calloused hands raised.

“What is the meaning of this?” he demanded, his voice shaking with fury.

The lead guard’s voice was a flat, metallic drone from behind his helmet. “We are here for the girl. Do not interfere.”

It was not a request. It was a verdict.

Lyra’s father’s face hardened into something ancient and terrible. A father’s face. In one swift motion, he grabbed the heavy woodcutting axe leaning by the hearth. He hefted it, its worn handle familiar in his grip. He planted his feet between the guards and his daughter.

“The only way you take my child,” he growled, the words raw and final, “is over my dead body.”

He was a strong man. A good man. He was not a soldier.

The guard didn’t even bother to draw his sword fully. He simply sidestepped the wild, desperate swing of the axe and, in a motion too quick to follow, drew a short blade from his hip. He lunged—not to disarm, but to destroy.

The first thrust pierced her father’s belly. The second, a vicious upward slash, opened his throat.

Lyra’s world slowed. She saw the axe fall from her father’s hands. She saw the surprise in his eyes, not yet pain, just a profound shock that this could happen in his own home, at his own table. He crumpled to the floor, the life rushing out of him in a dark, spreading pool that swallowed the fallen bread.

“RUN, LYR—!” her mother’s shriek was cut short.

A sword point erupted from the center of her chest, its tip glistening red. She looked down, confused. The guard behind her yanked the blade free. She staggered forward, her eyes finding Yuta, then Lyra. Her mouth moved, a bubble of blood forming on her lips.

“Protect… your sister… Y-Yuta…”

She fell across her husband’s legs.

Yuta screamed. A raw, shattered sound. He grabbed Lyra’s arm, yanking her toward the back door. “LYRA, RUN!”

Lyra was stone. She couldn’t move. Couldn’t leave them. Her parents. Her home. The lavender in the jar on the windowsill.

“Go, Yuta!” she finally choked out, shoving him toward the door. “Just go!”

The boy stumbled out into the twilight, turning back for her. “LYRA!”

From the treeline on the nearby hill, a bowstring twanged.

A black-fletched arrow took Yuta in the center of his small back. The force lifted him off his feet for a moment before he fell face-down in the dirt of the garden, his hand still stretched toward the house.

Lyra’s breath stopped. Her heart stopped. The universe stopped.

A shadow fell over her. She hadn’t heard him approach.

The cold kiss of a sword blade pressed against the side of her neck. A hand, clad in black leather, gripped her shoulder, its grip like iron.

She smelled expensive oil and cold metal. And beneath it, the copper stench of her family’s blood.

Prince Kaelros leaned down, his lips beside her ear. His voice was a whisper of silk and frost.

“I take what I like,” he said, as if explaining a simple, beautiful truth. “Whether it is a throne… or a flower.”

He laughed then. A soft, delighted sound that was more terrible than any scream.

Lyra did not fight. She did not speak. She stood in the ruins of her life, the cold steel on her neck, and watched the last of the light leave her brother’s still eyes.


And then, finally, silently, she began to cry.
